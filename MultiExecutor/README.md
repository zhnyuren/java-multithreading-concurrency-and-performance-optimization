In this exercise we are going to implement a MultiExecutor.

The client of this class will create a list of Runnable tasks and provide that list into MultiExecutor's constructor.

When the client runs the executeAll(), the MultiExecutor will execute all the given tasks.

To take full advantage of our multicore CPU, we would like the MultiExecutor to execute all the tasks in parallel, by passing each task to a different thread.
